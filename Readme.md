### Implementation

First Clone the repository: https://github.com/skystone1000/SBSPS-Challenge-1160-Predicting-the-energy-output-of-wind-turbine-based-on-weather-condition/

There are main 4 setps in creating the web-app:<br>
 Step 1 - Data Preprocessing 	<br>
 Step 2 - Building Models <br>
 Step 3 - UI Integration 	<br>
