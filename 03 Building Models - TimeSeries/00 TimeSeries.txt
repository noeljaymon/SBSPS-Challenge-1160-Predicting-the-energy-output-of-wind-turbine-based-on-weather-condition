Time Series Model Details
    - In our application we needed to forecast the future values for the power output.
    - ML models are used in case of classification and regression but are not very helpful 
    for predicting future values.
    - This was the main reason we decide to focus on the time series model.

Trends & Seasonality
    - First part while looking for timeSeries models is to check for trends and seasonality.
    - During initial Visulaisation we found there wase a slight seasonality during each month.
    - There was slight peak and drop of data point but was not very regular.

Stationarity
    - Next thing we look for is the stationarity.
    - To apply any timeseries model we need the data to be stationary and if its is 
    not predictions are very good so we have to make the data stationary by shifts with
    differencing or any other methods.

ARMA
    - Started with very basic model (Auto Regressive Moving Average)
    - Prediction were not perfect but were good to get going with it.
    - Faced a problem with predicting the future value count ie till what date and time to predict

ARIMA & SARIMAX
    - In this Used some P,Q,D values for the ARIMA model
    - The results were initialy vague but improving with fine tuning
